# my-pig-game 🐽

This repository contains the files of my own version of the Pig Game! This game was one of the very first JavaScript tutorial I followed and I wanted to create my own version and add a few "improvements" such as a leaderboard and a window rule.

## What I used 🔨
This project was build using HTML, CSS, and a lot of JavaScript! 😁

## Extra learning ✔
I also wanted to implement modal windows using JavaScript and to create a leaderboard using JS as well.

## Responsiveness ❕
This project is also responsive on any device screen, so I can play this game with friends on the bus, on a plane or anywhere else!
