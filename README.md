# my-pig-game 🐽

This project is my own version of the famous Pig game and it is one the very first JavaScript project I did alone. I actually take pride in implementing a leaderboard and a modal to set the rules of the game and the names of the two players!

## What I used 🔨
This project was build using HTML, CSS, and a lot of JavaScript! 😁

## Extra learning ✔
I also wanted to practice creating modal windows and to create a leaderboard using JS as well.

## Responsiveness 📱
This project is also responsive on any device screen, so I can play this game with friends on the bus, on a plane or anywhere else!
